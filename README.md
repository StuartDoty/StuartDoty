ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @StuartDoty, a Data Scientist with a lifelong love of numbers, graphs, maps and puzzles.  
I have a thirst for knowledge and am here to explore the world around us through data visualization, analysis and algorithm design.  
I am looking for new ways to help solve the greatest challenge of our day, global climate change.
